                    Halligan Helper is named after Halligan Hall, the Tufts Computer Science building. It enables students and faculty to see the current usage of the various lab machines in the building from anywhere. It also records this data and keeps track of usage over time. Additionally, it provides a real-time queue showing the line of students waiting for help from teacher's assistants.

                    This is a web application that I have taken on to help the Tufts Leonard Carmichael Society (LCS). Tufts LCS provides, among many other things, a tutoring service to the K-12 students in the areas surrounding our campus. This application will make it easier for the LCS administrators to facilitate matching and communcation between tutors and tutees.

                    This is a mobile app for Windows phone 7 that I started at the 2012 Tufts Hackathon. It is an implementation of Seinfeld's 'Don't Break the Chain' that was inspired by an article I read. 
                </p>
                <p>At the time of creation I was halfway through my very first programming course, which was being taught in a different programming language entirely. I was able to become familiar with C# and the Windows Phone 7 environment in a 24 hour period, and this project won the Windows Competition for the hackathon!</p>
