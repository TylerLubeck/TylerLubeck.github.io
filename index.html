                I'm Tyler Lubeck, a backend engineer based out of San Francisco.
                I graduated from the Tufts University School of Engineering in
                May, 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a
                minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership.

                I have a passion for Python and Django, and recently have been
                dabbling with Go. I love creating software that solves problems
                and makes a person's life easier.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
                I'm particularly interested in real time applications and
                well structured APIs. There's real power in websockets and
                the newer http/2 server push, and I look forward to leveraging
                these technologies in my future work.
            </p>

                I love to experiment with the newest buzzwordy software out
                there, but I think that production code should be boring.
                There's a time and a place for the hot new thing, and each
                technology should be evaluated in terms of its tradeoffs.
