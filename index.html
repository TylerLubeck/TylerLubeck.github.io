            <h1>Hi, I'm Tyler!</h1> 
            <p>I'm a fourth year student at Tufts University in the School of Engineering. I expect graduate in May 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership.</p> 
            <p>I'm also a backend developer with a passion for Django, Python, and creating APIs. I particularly love creating apps that solve people's problems. My pride and joy is <a href="projects.html#halliganhelper">Halligan Helper</a>, a system used to gather and display data about computer usage in the C.S. department at Tufts.</p>
