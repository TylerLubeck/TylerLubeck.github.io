                    Halligan Helper is named after Halligan Hall, the Tufts Computer Science building. It enables students and faculty to see the current usage of the various lab machines in the building from anywhere. It also records this data and keeps track of usage over time. Additionally, it provides a real-time queue showing the line of students waiting for help from teacher's assistants. 
                </p>
                <p>This project was born during a week of bad weather in Boston. I got tired of walking over to Halligan in the rain just to find out that all of the machines were in use. So I fired up the text editor and spun off some bash scripts to check the machines for me. I quickly realized that I wasn't the only one with this problem, and the entire application grew from there!</p>

                    This is a web application that I have taken on to help the Tufts Leonard Carmichael Society (LCS). Tufts LCS provides, among many other things, a tutoring service to the K-12 students in the areas surrounding our campus. The app will make it easier for the LCS administrators to facilitate matching and communcation between tutors and tutees.

                This is also the first time I've worked with a designer! Typically, I struggle through the design work myself. This time around, a friend and I are working together to deliver the best user experience possible.

                In its current form, Tufts Life is a website that allows for the student body of Tufts University to see what's going on on campus. It also allows them to buy items from, or sell items to, other students. This is a project that has existed in several iterations over the past few years, and one that I'm very happy to be a part of!
                </p>
                <p>The most recent rebuild effort intends to focus the website down to doing a few things, and doing them well. There will be a fast, easy way to find events that you'll be interested in on campus, as well as an easily accessible student exchange for your buying and selling needs. We intend to have an API available to other student developers so that they can benefit from the data store that we'll have.</p>

                    This is a mobile app for Windows phone 7 that I started at the 2012 Tufts Hackathon. It is an implementation of Seinfeld's 'Don't Break the Chain' that was inspired by an article I read. 
                </p>
                <p>At the time of creation I was halfway through my very first programming course, which was being taught in a different programming language entirely. I was able to become familiar with C# and the Windows Phone 7 environment in a 24 hour period, and this project won the Windows Competition for the hackathon!</p>
