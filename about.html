            <h4>Learning</h4> 
            <p>In May 2015, I'll be graduating from Tufts University with a B.S. in Computer Science. I've taken courses ranging from computer architecture to computer security to web engineering. While Tufts doesn't offer specializations, I've been magnetically drawn to programming for the web.</p>

            <h4>Teaching</h4> 
            <p>When I'm not busy, I can almost always be found in Tufts' Computer Science building. I truly love helping the students in the introductory courses master their material, and I've been a Teacher's Assistant and Tutor since halfway through my freshman year.</p>

            <h4>Experimenting</h4> 
            <p>New technologies and tools are fascinating to me, and I spend as much time as possible learning as much as I can. I love being on the bleeding edge and experimenting, and I try to familarize myself with at least one new technology per project.</p>

            <h4>Playing</h4> 
            <p>On nights and weekends, I can be found in the kitchen experimenting with food. I love to cook and bake, and I specialize in homemade pizzas and cupcakes. I'm also an offroad and boating enthusiast, and love spending time in the woods or on the water.</p>
