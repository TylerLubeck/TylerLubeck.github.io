                <p>
                Professionally, I'm a backend engineer that dabbles in
                operations and devops. I love automating everything I can, and
                I love building tools that allow other developers to be more
                productive.
                </p>
                <p>
                I have strong experience in building robust, scalable systems
                that are monitored, self-healing, and well documented.

                <p>
                I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Tufts University
                in 2015. Since then I've continured my pursuit of knowledge
                by attending conferences and meetups, taking Udemy classes,
                and experimenting with new technologies.

                <h4>Teaching</h4> 
                <p>
                One of my true joys is teaching - I love helping others learn
                anything that they're interested in. In my current role, I help
                lead our new hire onboarding trainings.
