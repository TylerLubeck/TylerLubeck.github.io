                <h4>Working</h4> 
                <p>Professionally, I've held several internships and worked on projects ranging from automating menial tasks to creating javascript web modules. More information can be found on my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>. I also actively maintain several <a href="projects.html">side projects</a>, most of which center around helping various groups on my school's campus. </p>

                <h4>Learning</h4> 
                <p><span class="fa fa-graduation-cap bigfa inline-image"></span>In May 2015, I'll be graduating from Tufts University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I've taken courses ranging from computer architecture to computer security to web engineering. While Tufts doesn't offer specializations, I've been magnetically drawn to programming for the web.</p>

                <h4>Teaching</h4> 
                <p>When I'm not busy with my own work, I can almost always be found in Tufts' Computer Science building. I truly love helping the students in the introductory courses master their material, and I've been a Teacher's Assistant and Tutor since halfway through my freshman year.</p>

                <h4>Experimenting</h4> 
                <p>New technologies and tools are fascinating to me, and I spend as much time as possible learning as much as I can. I love being on the bleeding edge and experimenting, and I try to familarize myself with at least one new technology per project.</p>

                <h4>Playing</h4> 
                <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery inline-image"></span>On nights and weekends, I can be found in the kitchen experimenting with food. I love to cook and bake, and I specialize in homemade pizzas and cupcakes. It's great fun to have a potluck dinner with a bunch of friends! I'm also an offroad and boating enthusiast, and love spending time in the woods or on the water.</p>
